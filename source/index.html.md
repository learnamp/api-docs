Welcome to Learn Amp API reference.

The Learn Amp API is organised around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Getting Started


To get started, you will need:

1. An account on the Learn Amp platform
