Welcome to Learn Amp API reference.

The Learn Amp API is organised around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
